<h3> Supporting digital entrepreneurs </h3>
<b>The digital economy can also have an important role in encouraging inclusion and alleviating poverty,</b> for example, by reducing information asymmetries for poor or rural workers, and by fostering entry into the productive labor force of women and younger workers. Young people, consistently the earliest adopters and adapters of digital technologies, often seek employment in high-tech sectors and can be critical to developing a skilled workforce that is internationally competitive in an increasingly interconnected world. Entrepreneurs with digital skills in developing countries are much more likely to export, to more destinations, and to survive in the marketplace. It is important for technical and financial partners to support digital entrepreneurs.</p>
