<h3> What is YALI RLC ?</h3>
The Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) was launched by the United States government as a signature effort to invest in the next generation of African leaders.YALI promotes three models designed to identify and empower young leaders: the YALI Mandela Washington Fellowship, YALI Network and now the establishment of Regional Leadership Centers across Africa.
Supporting this progress, the Accra Regional Leadership Centre (RLC), as part of the United States government initiative, Young African Leadership Initiative (YALI), offer an innovative and game changing leadership training program in Africa. The program is hosted by Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration (GIMPA).

<h3> What deserve me  to be a YALI RLC Participant?</h3>
<p>
When I heart about YALI for the first time on my Facebook page, it was an evidence for me to apply for that amazing program: It was an opportunity  to build my capacity and skills on leadership and entrepreneurship. As I have started some entrepreneurship activity like shopping, farming and a digital startup, the needs to participate in the YALI RLC West Africa was a must for my professional career. the thing that deserves me to be a YALI participant was my commitment to learn, go back to me country and do something better. </p>

<h3> Here we are... </h3>

<p>We started the program on 12 March and the first day was an orientation and coaching session designed to familiarise ourselves with the program, to reiterate our commitment  and to network for the first time.
 The day after was about the opening ceremony, all Yalians was involved on its preparation as a team and coordinated by facilitators. We need a red carpet and we, Yalians collected the money to get our red carpet for the opening ceremony! we arranged the room at our convenience and for the visitors. During the ceremony, we were dressed in traditional way. Setting in our chair, all Yalians was looking around, waiting for something big! The High quality visitor speech us, we get informed, inspired and aware of the opportunity we have. What I learnt during the speech was 6000 USD was spent for every participant to complete the program and they urge us to do make a difference in our community after the program. We made the opening ceremony something big:  Each team country was dancing, singing and pitching</p>

<h3> YALI Leaders, yes we are <br>
This is what we pledge to do <br>
We will plan a strategy <br>
Action plan to implement <br> </h3>
<p>
This is a song, all YALIan know. we learned it the first day of the class on 13 March by Prof Danquah the lecturer. During that day, we learn a lot about leadership: Its different definition and different areas, but there is one definition that illuminate my minds and that I noted. That definition says : Leadership is the ability to identify a needed change (ability to gather harness necessary human, educational, technological ressources) in order that get it to be done.  We heart about CROP Concept in Leadership : CROP stand for Creativity as thinking differently about something, Ressource seeking, Opportunity seeking, Persistence. we also learnt about the critical team leadership skills for YALI Participants: powerful vision, team goal, set deadline, undertake team building and building team cohesion. We made self assessment to understand our leadership skills.
 We also took seriously Networking course that day. We made an amazing exercise: 121 participant were asked to queue by date of birth (day and month) without talking, it was funny and each of us, learn a little bit about others.

The powerful words I remember for this day from a participant was: “ Don’t be a visitor to your own vision”
</p>

<h3>A Leader is an Ordinary person doing extraordinary things </h3>
<p>This is one of the Leader’s definition I captured quickly on 14 March as it  says a lot.  During the day2, “the leading others” course was on the spot. I learnt a lot on this course: Leading others is about Team  - Together Everyone Achieve More. we focused on understanding team member’s and team personalities and professional qualities through lectures and self-team evaluation.</p>
